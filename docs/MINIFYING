To get from Windmill.js to Windmill-golfed.js:

(1) Using your favorite text editor, manually remove all /* ... */
block comments,

(2) manually remove or comment out the one debugme() call which spans
multiple lines  (in the function runDefenderStrategies())  and the
definition of the function  (near the end),

(3) manually remove or comment out the explicit console.log() calls
conditioned on DEBUG_PATTERN_CHECK_VERBOSELY  (in the pattern engine
functions near the end of the file, including the conditional on DEBUGME
around two of them)  and the definition of this variable  (near the
beginning),

(4) save the result to an intermediate file,

(5) and run this through the bin/minify-Windmill.pl filter.

This last step will remove all //-comments, one-line debugme() calls,
and indentation and much other whitespace including many line endings,
and replace all variable and function identifiers with abbreviations.
The filter rules will need updating when significant amounts of new
identifiers are added to the .js source.

Thus the ~140KB source will be condensed into the ~41KB version
suitable for a PPCG answer.

(The answer size limit on https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/ is 65536
characters, which is already larger than the general StackExchange default.
Bear in mind though that code blocks are marked-down by indenting every
line with 4 spaces, which would add back several KB to the code size if
the Perl script didn't run together many shortish lines into a much
smaller number of rather long lines.)
