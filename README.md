This repository provides the unabridged, commented source code for my [Windmill](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/135102/formic-functions-ant-queen-of-the-hill-contest/143980#143980) submission to trichoplax's [Formic Functions - Ant Queen of the Hill Contest](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/135102/formic-functions-ant-queen-of-the-hill-contest).

It also documents how the source has been minified to fit within the [Programming Puzzles and Code Golf](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/) size limits on StackExchange.

For the controller code, see [trichoplax's Formic Functions repository](https://github.com/trichoplax/formic-functions) here on GitHub.
